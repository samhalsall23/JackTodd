    "description": "This e-magazine was created to be a direct reflection of the Chanel 10 TV series ‘The Offroad Adventure Show’. The series follows a crew of 4WDers who explore Australia traversing some of its toughest and most unforgiving destinations. I was fortunate enough to be able to design and publish issue #2, issue #3, and issue #4 of the season 8 editions of the e-magazine. Each issue was roughly 80 pages long. \n\n For these e-magazines, I was supplied with copy, images, and video clips, and given complete freedom to layout all elements in a way that guided the reader from beginning to end. Important considerations I had to abide by during this process were making sure that the layout of the elements did justice to the story being told, and that the design was consistent with the branding of the show and previous magazines. \n\n To accompany the magazines, I created a collateral of promotional material that was used to promote the publications through EDMS and social media.",

    "description": "A new Melbourne-based fine art and photography printing company approached me with a branding opportunity. This was primarily a logo design, with a focus on a versatile brand mark. \n\n For the primary logo, we used a typography-based design with an emphasis on strength and trust. These concepts are conveyed through the tight kerning of the lettering, as well as the bold yet sharp nature of the font. \n\n For the brand mark, we used a camera shutter vector as a reference back to the nature of the business; a fine art and photography printing service. As the primary logo is wider, this icon is a more versatile option for certain contexts that may not be ideal for the text logo.",

    "description": "This is a project I worked on in collaboration with UFC heavyweight Tai ‘Bam Bam’ Tuivasa. His management reached out with the possibility of designing some merchandise for him. I wanted to create something suitable for everyday wear, while still representing the nature of Tai’s sport; mixed martial arts. \n\n Due to timing issues, these designs never made it to print. However, this was a fantastic opportunity for me to work with a public figure who I admire like Tai, and gain experience in a realm of design that was somewhat foreign to me.",

    "description": "This Annual Report aims to juxtapose the exquisite charm of the Royal Botanical Gardens with the typically mundane nature of an annual report. The black-and-white visuals deliberately contrast with the vibrant, real-life spectacle of the gardens, symbolizing the presentation of business data and information. \n\nThroughout the document, the inclusion of full-page photographs serves as a breathing point for readers amidst the information-heavy content. This is a project I completed in 2019, and is what founded my passion for publication and layout design.",

The unconventional, curved lines and the layered arrangement of the lettering effectively fulfill this mandate, ensuring a design that not only aligns with the festivity but also maintains readability.",

During this process, we were provided with copy, images, and video clips, and given complete creative freedom to arrange elements seamlessly from start to finish. The Journey magazine boasts a minimalist style, incorporating bold headings to captivate readers. Maintaining a cohesive design was crucial to the editor, Leanne O’Neill, and I believe we successfully achieved this harmonious flow between the two designers. ",
